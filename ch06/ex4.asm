;
; Write an assembly language program to compute the cost of elec-
; tricity for a home. The cost per kilowatt hour will be an integer
; number of pennies stored in a memory location. The kilowatt hours
; used will also be an integer stored in memory. The bill amount will
; be $5.00 plus the cost per kilowatt hour times the number of kilo-
; watt hours over 1000. You can use a conditional move to set the
; number of hours over 1000Â· to 0 if the number of hours over 1000
; is negative. Move the number of dollars into one memory location
; and the number of pennies into another.
