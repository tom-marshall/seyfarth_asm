; Ex 2
;
; Write an assembly program to generate an array of random integers
; (by calling the C library function random), to sort the array using a
; bubble sort function and to print the array. The array should be stored
; in the bss segment and does not need to be dynamically allocated. The
; number of elements to fill, sort and print should be stored in a memory
; location. Write a function to loop through the array elements filling
; the array with random integers. Write a function to print the array
; contents. If the array size is less than or equal to 20, call your print
; function before and after printing.
